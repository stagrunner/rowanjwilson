**Rowan "Stag" Wilson** is a digital artist, content creator, and community/social media manager in the Central New York area. He is a grizzled ancient of the digital age and boasts over a decade of experience in the creation/curation of online communities (and their social media!). He specializes in building presences in the gaming space and takes great pride in assisting in the creation of progressive, LGBT-centric spaces.

In addition to his auspicious work in community & social media management, Rowan boasts an affinity for digital art and web design. Though he's chosen to focus his career on the people *behind* web sites rather than the sites themselves, he still enjoys making time to tinker and create websites.

Off the clock, Rowan is a dedicated dog dad & dungeon master. As with any child of the new millennium, he spends a fair amount of his time gaming... poorly. He also collects vintage cast iron, for some reason. Ask him about it!
