# Hey Howdy, I'm Rowan!
*(However, most folks online know me as "Stag!")*

*Don't have time for the whole song & dance? A static .pdf of my resume can be found [HERE](https://rowanjwilson.com/).*

I've been shaping & stewarding online communities for over a decade- well before terms like Social Media Manager or Community Manager had hit the mainstream. From TeamSpeak to Twitter and every step in between: if online communities (especially *gaming* communities) congregated on it, I built a space on it. I know what makes a good community and social media presence in games, because I have been on the ground floor to see the *birth* of community & social media platforms for games.

I'm not just passionate about community & social media management in gaming because I love games. I'm passionate about it because I love the developers and fans *behind* those games. I love taking social media & community platforms (such as Reddit, Twitter & Discord), crafting spaces, and turning those spaces alchemy-like into a place that bridges the gap between the people who make games and the people who love them.
