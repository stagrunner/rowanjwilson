# Hey Howdy, I'm Rowan!
*(However, most folks online know me as "Stag!")*

*Don't have time for the whole song & dance? A static .pdf of my resume can be found [HERE](https://rowanjwilson.com/).*

I've been shaping & stewarding online communities for over a decade- well before terms like Social Media Manager or Community Manager had hit the mainstream. From TeamSpeak to Twitter and every step in between: if online communities (especially *gaming* communities) congregated on it, I built a space on it. I know what makes a good community and social media presence in games, because I have been on the ground floor to see the *birth* of community & social media platforms for games.

I'm not just passionate about community & social media management in gaming because I love games. I'm passionate about it because I love the developers and fans *behind* those games. I love taking social media & community platforms (such as Reddit, Twitter & Discord), crafting spaces, and turning those spaces alchemy-like into a place that bridges the gap between the people who make games and the people who love them.



### What I Do:

<p style="font-size:14px">
I've been moderating online spaces for over a decade. I have an in-depth understanding of how socialization in online communities works, as well as how to help ensure activity stays aligned with a space's tenets. A good community manager understands how to use platform moderation toolkits to keep members in line. A great community manager understands how to communicate effectively with their users <i>before</i> a situation necessitates using the banhammer.
<br /><br />
That said... I have experience with a variety of platforms' moderation toolkits, including but not limited to:

  <li>Discord</li>
  <li>Twitch</li>
  <li>Reddit</li>
  <li>Steam Community Forums</li>
  <li>Professional Forum Software (IPB, vBulletin, Xenforo, etc.)</li>
</ul>
