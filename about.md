**Rowan** was born in Upstate New York, September 1994, on a normal overcast day. He's been a problem ever since.

He's also been playing games & working with computers since he was old enough to sit upright at one.

Everything he knows- social media, community management, graphic design- he's taught himself. He's always hungry to learn new skills & new methods to improve his craft. And while he still may be teaching himself how to land headshots in Halo after decades... he takes pride in his skill in crafting & maintaining committed, engaged communities.

Beyond his (immense) love for tech, gaming & esports, Rowan is a tabletop aficionado and dedicated Dungeon Master. He has corgi mix, Josephine "Josie" Muttilyet, who you are absolutely encouraged to ask about. He's also an ordained minister, for some reason. Ask him about the Guild Wars 2 dungeon he (maybe) was responsible for breaking!
